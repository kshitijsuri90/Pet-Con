## Ideation
Attended Hack Infinity at DA IICT with Rajat Sharma recently and it was a definitely rollercoaster ride for us! We made a climate change based game app. Here you get a pet on joining, like a normal virtual pet, but the catch here is that if you want the pet to evolve and grow you have to try and use public transportation. The more public transport you use, the better health your pet. The more you use Private vehicles health decreases. Plus there is an option to gain health by contributing to RaaS API, lent to us by Jonathan Villiard to gain health so that a tree is planted for every dollar you spend.
